# IGN History of Mario

The History of Mario article inspired by Intel and built for IGN.com. It will be divided into distinct screens referred to henceforth as “game-pages”. Users will be able to swipe/scroll through the interactive pages. Tweets from famous personas at IGN and Nintendo will be displayed on every screen with the ability to Retweet. If a user Tweets with the hashtag #mariomemories #html5hub, they’ll be submitted into a global contest to win an Intel Ultrabook or a copy of the new Mario3DWorld out this December.
